You are enough just as you are.
Every day is a second chance.
Keep taking time for yourself.
Breathe. Relax. Trust.
You’ve survived 100% of your worst days.
Healing is not linear.
You don’t have to be perfect to be worthy.
It’s okay to ask for help.
Be gentle with yourself, you're doing your best.
Your feelings are valid.
Give yourself the same compassion you give others.
This too shall pass.
You are stronger than you think.
It's okay to rest.
Feelings are not facts — they pass.
Take life one breath at a time.
Progress, not perfection.
Storms don’t last forever.
Your story matters.
You're allowed to feel everything.
Peace begins with you.
One small step is still progress.
Let go of what you can’t control.
Hope is a quiet but powerful thing.
Take care of your heart.
Be your own biggest cheerleader.
